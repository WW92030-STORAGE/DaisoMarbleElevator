# DaisoMarbleElevator
Marble elevator system for the Daiso D-TRAX puzzle game (Constructed using Fusion 360). <br/>

The elevator fits into a 2x2 grid space on the base board. It is also theoretically infinitely expandable but at present the system is of fixed construction (3-4 blocks high).<br/>
The game kits contain two boards each. It is recommended to use both boards. The base module is 2 blocks high and further layers are 1 block high each.
