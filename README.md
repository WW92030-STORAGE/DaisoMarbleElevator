# DaisoMarbleElevator
Marble elevator system for the Daiso D-TRAX puzzle game (Constructed using Fusion 360). <br/>

The elevator fits into a 2x2 grid space on the base board. Currently the marble must exit in the same horizontal position and direction that it entered the elevator through. <br/>

The elevator is theoretically infinitely expandable but at present the system is of fixed construction.
